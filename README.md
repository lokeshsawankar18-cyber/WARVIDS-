“WARVIDS: Wireless Autonomous Rover for Vision-based Intelligent Defence System”

*PROJECT  OVERVIEW*

1.WARVIDS is a wireless autonomous rover designed to combine mobility, surveillance, and intelligent targeting into a single platform.

2.The system uses head-tracking for natural camera alignment, dual-mode control for flexible operation, and wireless video streaming for real-time awareness.

3.Sensors such as IR modules and IMUs ensure reliable obstacle detection and navigation. 

4.The platform aims to enhance operator responsiveness while reducing physical risk in hazardous environments. Its modular architecture supports both defence and civil applications.


*Problem Statement*

Human Risk - Entering hazardous or combat areas is unsafe for humans..

Difficult Manual Control– Controlling camera and targeting systems manually is complex and slow.

High Operator Stress– Operators must control movement, camera, and targeting at the same time, causing errors.

Need for Natural Control– Existing systems lack intuitive control like head-movement tracking.

Therefore, a mobile rover with live video streaming and head-tracking control is required for safe and efficient remote surveillance.
